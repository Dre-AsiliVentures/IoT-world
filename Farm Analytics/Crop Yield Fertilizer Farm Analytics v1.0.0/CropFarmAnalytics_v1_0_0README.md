In this app, the user can select a crop from a sidebar and generate a histogram of yield and fertilizer values based on that crop. The cropdata.csv file is loaded at the beginning of the script and used to calculate the mean and standard deviation values for yield and fertilizer for the selected crop. The app uses the streamlit.sidebar function to create a sidebar for selecting the crop, and the streamlit.slider function to allow the user to select the number of samples to generate. Finally, the streamlit.hist function is used to display the histograms of yield and fertilizer values.
